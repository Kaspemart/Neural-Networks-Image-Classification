# Neural-Networks-Image-Classification

Accurate image classification plays an important role in shaping the success of businesses like Zalando. This technology elevates customer satisfaction by delivering personalized product recommendations and streamlining the shopping journey with improved search functionalities.

It also aids in maintaining efficient inventory levels, allowing Zalando to respond effectively to customer demands. The ability to tailor marketing strategies based on precise classifications enables targeted promotions, while the reduction in return rates enhances operational efficiency.

In the competitive landscape of fashion retail, Zalando's commitment to accurate item classification not only minimizes costs but also solidifies its position as an industry leader.

Our task is to build a Neural Networks model such that we can correctly classify the object on the image.

Dataset description: Fashion-MNIST is a dataset of Zalando's article images consisting of a training set of 60,000 examples and a test set of 10,000 examples. Each example is a 28x28 grayscale image, associated with a label from 10 classes.

Each image pixel has a grayscale value from 0 to 255 (0 = as dark as possible, 255 = as light as possible)

Here's an example of what the data looks (each class takes three-rows):
